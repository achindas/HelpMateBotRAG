       "9  A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal. If death occurs within one year of the start of ADL Disability or Total Disability, but before The Principal has received first proof, then final proof must be sent within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. c.

       "9  A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal. If death occurs within one year of the start of ADL Disability or Total Disability, but before The Principal has received first proof, then final proof must be sent within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. c.

       "4  A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal. If death occurs within one year of the start of ADL Disability or Total Disability, but before The Principal has received first proof, then final proof must be sent within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. c.

       "4  A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal.

Unless a Beneficiary has been designated, payment will be to the Member if he or she survives the Dependent. If the Member does not survive the Dependent and a beneficiary for Dependent Life has not been named, payment will be to the person named as beneficiary for Member Life Insurance. However, if the Member is suspected or charged with the Dependent's death, the Death Benefits Payable may be withheld until additional information has been received or the trial has been held. If the Member is found guilty of the Dependent's death, he or she may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to the executor or administrator of the Dependent's estate. Payment will be subject to the Beneficiary provisions in Article 3 and the Facility of Payment and Settlement of Proceeds provisions of PART IV, Section A. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Dependent's death.   \n",

Unless a Beneficiary has been designated, payment will be to the Member if he or she survives the Dependent. If the Member does not survive the Dependent and a beneficiary for Dependent Life has not been named, payment will be to the person named as beneficiary for Member Life Insurance. However, if the Member is suspected or charged with the Dependent's death, the Death Benefits Payable may be withheld until additional information has been received or the trial has been held. If the Member is found guilty of the Dependent's death, he or she may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to the executor or administrator of the Dependent's estate. Payment will be subject to the Beneficiary provisions in Article 3 and the Facility of Payment and Settlement of Proceeds provisions of PART IV, Section A. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Dependent's death.   \n",
